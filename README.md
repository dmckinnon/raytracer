# raytracer

Currently looking at photon mapping, then progressive photon mapping, then stochastic progressive photon mapping
To know photon mapping, going through literature from scratch

Need to learn now:
monte carlo ray tracing
the rendering equation - kajiya
backwards ray tracing - arvo

Monte carlo:
theory - http://old.cescg.org/CESCG97/csebfalvi/
implementation - https://github.com/kbladin/Monte_Carlo_Ray_Tracer
a review of monte carlo, and other ray tracing methods: https://eriksvjansson.net/papers/mcrt.pdf

notes in onenote or on paper
